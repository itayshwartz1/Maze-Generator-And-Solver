# Maze-Generator-And-Solver
## About The Project
Imagine that you wake up inside a maze. What strategy should you take to visit as few cells as possible to find the exit? 
In this project I created a program that randomly creates a maze, and then solves it according to different algorithms and try to decide which is better.

## Built With
The project was built in JAVA combined with a GUI library called biuoop-1.4.jar

## Getting Started
First you need to download this project to your choosen file. 
After thet you need to run the program via some IDE or CMD. The file that needs to be run is called Main.java and it is inside the src folder.
## Demonstration
After you run the Project you see the start screen:

Then you should press Enter key to start the creation of the maze (The maze is produced recursively):
After the cration is over you can choos where the starting point and the end point will located:

Then the program will solve the maze with 3 algorithems:
